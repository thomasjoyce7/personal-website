Introduction
============

I'm a second-year Biostatistics Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I work with Dr. Baiming Zou as a Graduate Research Assistant. I'm also a member of [Li Lab @ UNC](https://sites.google.com/view/didongli/). Before coming to UNC, I completed my B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics ([ACMS](https://acms.nd.edu/)) at the University of Notre Dame.

My research interests include machine learning, large language models, electronic health records, and environmental health. I am motivated by the challenges of analyzing messy, heterogeneous, and often unstructured data types common in healthcare settings. By integrating emerging AI tools with statistical approaches, I hope to develop more reliable models for health outcome prediction and improve clinical decision-making.

Beyond coursework and research, I serve as the Webmaster for UNC's Graduate Biostatistics Student Association ([GBSA](https://bsa.web.unc.edu/)) and participate in the Mentorship and Advice for Prospective Students (MAPS) program. I'm always happy to answer questions about graduate studies in biostatistics and can be reached at [tjoyce7@unc.edu](mailto:tjoyce7@unc.edu). Outside of academia, I enjoy distance running and have completed two marathons.
